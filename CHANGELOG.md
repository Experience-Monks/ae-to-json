# 1.1.1

Fixed:

- Camera and light layers (or layers which don't have a source) won't crash the exporter.

# 1.1.0

Features:

- Implemented `mainSource` and `file` for FootageItems
- Parsing setup for types `alphaMode`, `fieldSeparationType`, and `removePulldown`
- Added `source` to Layers which is either `null` or a path to the file.
